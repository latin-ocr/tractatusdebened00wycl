‘242 NOTES.

P. 80, 1. 26.—W. has tripped here. Philaster is several times
quoted by Augustine as the author of a catalogue of heresies, not as
himself a heretic, (3.9. De Heres. xli. (Tom. VIII. p. 12). Philaster
Brixianus episcopus in prolixissimo libro quem de heresibus condidit
et cxxviii haereses arbitratus est computandas.

P. 80, 1. 30.—Me2'0affl'smom'te. Aug. de Her. LVIII. (Tom. VIII.
p. 20). Metangismonitae (μεταψγισμός vas m vase) dicentes sic esse
in Patre Filium quomodo vas in vase.

P. 81, l. 5.—apoer1'fa as opposed here to autentica and to canonica
(supra, p. ll, l. 4) means in W. the writings of Fathers and Doctors,
as distinguished from Holy Scripture, which latter would of course
include ‘the Apocrypha’ of our old Bibles. Trialogus, p. 239.
Scriptura sacra infinitum magis autentica et credenda—scripta aliorum
doctorum magnorum quantumcunque vera, dicuntur apocrifa. From
the use which W. makes of the books of Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, and
Baruch (v. Index Ι.) 111 this treatise, one infers that in his earlier
days he gave them the full value of Holy Scripture. But only four
years after his death, in the revised Wycliffite version, put forth by
Purvey 111 1388, the same distinction between canonical and apocry-
phal books is made as in our Sixth Article. Among ‘ apocrifa that is
bookis withouten autorite of bileue' are placed ‘ii bookis Ecclesiastici
and Sapience Which the Chirche redith to edifying of the people and
not to conferme the autorite of techingis of Holy Chirche.' Madden
and ForshalL i. 1. Probably this represents W.’s own view towards
the close of his life; and if 50 we have another instance of his gradually
shaking himself free of Roman tradition.

P. 81, l. 9. -exposz'torw, a logical fallacy ‘ deceptorius paralogis-
mus.' Trial. 273. Cf. also Trial. p. 64, and De Ecclesia, p. 31.

P. 82, l. 18.—lear82'tes, apparently another logical fallacy.

P. 83, 1. 1.—Au9ustz'ne'8 Treatise according to the Benedictine
editors (Tom. VIII. p. 28) ends with Heresis 88, the N estorian and
Eutychian heresies not being known by those names until after the
death of Augustius. The passage quoted below, l. 2—12, is from the
spurious appendix to Aug. de Heresibus.

P. 83, l. 29.—The passage from De Visit. Inf. is quoted at length
infra, p. 100.

P. 84, l. 28.—Hooker‚ E. P. V. liv. 10, sums up the doctrine of
the Incarnation in four adverbs like these three of W.’s ——chyOu‘m
τελέως, ἀδιαιρέτως, ἀσυγχύτως. An earlier attempt had ἀτρέπτως,
ἀχωρίστως for the first two.

P. 85, 1. 22.-Τ1115 was Docetism, that Christ had only the appear-
ance [ἑόκησις] of man.

P. 86, l. 20.—W. returns to this argument, infra, p. 155.

P. 88, l. 8.—proeessus, general drift. Cf. p. 24, l. 14.

P. 89, 1. 27.—syneodoelzz'ea‚ p. 56, 1. 4, note.

P. 91, l. 26.—pr0ereat2‘ ab incubis et sueozcbz's. W. means such as
Grendel in Beowulf, and Robert le Diable. A touch of medieval
superstition.
