xvi PREFACE.

done on my own responsibility, and was a matter often of doubt-
and difficulty. This MS„ kindly lent me on two occasions for
considerable periods by the Provost and Fellows of Oriel, I
copied carefully; and have since collated niy copy, and lastly
the printed text and notes with it.

The Vienna Codex A. was copied for me with great care by
ΜΓ. Rudolph Beer, who also collated B and C, and supplied
me with their variations: my proofs have been returned to
him for a second collation. In this respect, therefore, every—
thing has been done which which could be done to secure the
result aimed at, that is, that this edition should place the
reader in possession of the facts.

As to the construction of the text, although naturally inclined
to lean on the one English copy O, with which alone I was
personally familiar, yet after comparing its readings in many
places with those of A, B, C, I did not feel justified in taking
the easier and less responsible course of printing the text
either of O or of any one of the codices, and appending the
variant readings of the rest 111 the margin: but it seemed best
to select from all the materials at command, including the
fragmentary Codex M, what appeared to be in each case of
discrepancy the best reading, and to place that on the page,
noting at the foot the alternatives supplied by the other MSS.
And in this I had Lechler's Trialogus as a precedent. In very
few instances, never without a statement at the foot, have I
departed from the authority of the MSS. entirely. Hence,
wherever I am right, the reader’s purpose is served; he has
before him the best text; where I 3111 wrong, he has at hand
the materials for a inore correct judgment.

For the sake of completeness Ι have made 110 distinction
between important and uni1·nportant variations, and have placed
all readings of A, Β, C, O not embodied in the text into the notes
at the foot of the page, with the exception of the numberless
