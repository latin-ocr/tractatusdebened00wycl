236 NOTES.

eseqsjayuyue'vov πρηνὴς «γενόμενος ἐλάκησε μέσος, καὶ πεσὼν εὐθὺς
ἀπέψυξεν. The superstitious idea that heretics died by ‘visitation of
God’ was thus applied later to Wyclif himself. ‘⁴ On the feast of the
passion of St. Thomas of Canterbury (when he had the intention to
preach and allow himself in a blasphemous attack upon the saint)
John Wyfflf, that organ of the devil, etc„ being struck by the
horrible judgment of God was struck with palsy, and continued to
live in that condition until St. Silvester's day, whom he had often
exasperated by his attackS.’' Walsingham quoted by Lechler, ii.
290-2‚ 296.

P. 14, 1. 4.—Ambrosius de Fide i. 19.

P. 14, 1. 10.-—See p. 3, 1. 26, and note, for Peter Lombard’s words.

P. 17, 1. 14.-]οφιίαίῑῗέθν apparently means—as from a fountain.

P. 17, 1. 15.-θΐε)”φῑαῖίίεν ad intra. Cf. supra, p. 10, ll. 21-24.
Wyclif is speaking of the eternal §eneration of the Son by the Father,
when he speaks of One who utters the Word eternally within Himself.

P. 18, 1. 29.——The distinction derived from Augustine of homo interior
and exterior is a favourite one with W. Cf. p. 30, 1. 7, and p. 128, 1. 24.

P. 19, 1. 27.—Anselm de Incarnacione, cii. The passage referred
to is important as giving Anselm's opinion on the realistic controversy.
‘Illi utique nostri temporis dialectici, immo dialectice heretici, qui
non nisi flatum vocis putant esse universales substantias, et qui
colorem non aliud queunt intelligere quam corpus, nec sapientiam
hominis aliud quam animam, prorsus a spiritualium questionum dis-
putatione sunt exsufflandi. Cf. infra, p. 144,v l. 27.

P. 20,1. 10.—The relation of the universal to the individua] is
diseussed infra, pp. 86, 145, and in Trialogus‚ p. 276.

P. 20, 1. 22.-Μιιῖέι” enim—de vi vocis. In Fasc. Zizan. p. 20,
Kenyngham raises this question of the literal truth of Holy Scripture,
and adds that W. makes a distinction between de vi vocis and de-
vz'rtnte sermonis, whereas he himself regards them as synonymous.
On Wyclif' 5 reliance on the litera] meaning of Scriptum, cf. Lechler’s
Wyclif and his English Precursors, Eng. ed. vol. ii. pp. 31, 40. In
the last sentence of our treatise, W. claims to have shown how
‘scriptura sacra de Incarnacione ad litteram est sustinenda!

P. 23, l. 16.-inearceraez7one. This word Ι doubtfully placed in the
text to meet the sense, instead of the uncertain reading of the MSS.
incarnacione is perhaps supported by p. 36, l. 7 infra, z'noz'neracz'one by

. 64, 1. 28.
P P. 24, 1. 14.—-processus evanyelz'cns, the general drift of the Gospels.

P. 24, 1. 21.—Walden falls foul of this passage, D. F. 1. 41. ‘Sed
dicis “ ego dico Christum esse Deum in natura, quod Arius non facit,
sed dixit Christum pure creaturam : quod ego non facio.” Vere jam
video doctrinam tuam non esse tutam, quia a fortissima heresi solo
distat adverbio pure: ita quod si tollatur gracilis duarum syllabarum
dictio, id ipsum sine variatione sentiretis utrique.'

P. 24, 1. 34.-F0r Augustine’s rule, cf. supra, p. 6,1. 30, and p. 9, l. 6.'
