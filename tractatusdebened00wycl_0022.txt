xviii PREFACE.

the original treatise. The argument in it. is somewhat involved,
and there is a remarkable sentence at the foot of page 135,
which bespealzs so much greater freedom in the use of Greek
metaphysical terms than Wyclif usually displays, that one feels
almost inclined to follow O in rejecting it. However, the
existence of the passage was known to the annotator of O, who
writes in the margin ‘ deficit muitum?

The other omission on page 168, line 25, to page 170, line 15
is curicus. The omitted passage consists of a quotation from
a Decreta] and the application of it to Wyclif’ 5 argument:
and there is no hint 111 the margin of O of any omission. I
can only suggest that perhaps a Lollard copyist or his employer
did not set much store by a papal anathema. It is even possible
that Wyclif himself in his later years may have preferred to
withdraw an argument which rests on the dictum of one Pope
Alexander HL, the patron of Thomas a Becket and adversary
of Henry H„ and which had been reissued by another Gregory
IX„ the oppressor of Henry ΙΙΙ. On the other hand, the
only other reference to a Decretal in this book (page 122,
line 15) stands in all the four codices alike. And it is quite
possible that O, instead of being from a later, may be from an
earlier ‘edition' of the treatise, and A, B, O may be from a
later one to which the author had added as subsidiary argu-
ments the additional passages not found in O.

It is perhaps remarkable that so many copies of this treatise
should survive, especially when we remember on the one hand
the attempts to exterminate the works of Wyclif, and 011 the
other the nature of the treatise. It has not the popular interest
of the English sermons or of the polemical 113615, still less of
the English Bible. And it is among the works, copies of which
were publicly burnt at Prague on July 16, A.D. 1410. Dr.
Johann Loserth has given 115 the following interesting account
of the condemnation and burning of the Wyclif books in his
