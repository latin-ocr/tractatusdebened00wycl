Ohrist's Body, remains bread as to its substance as well as in
its accidents.’l

2. The year 1885 ended with a balance in the Society's
favour of 5832? odd, after paying ς;Εἷ178 for the printing (and
in 1884, 5321 for the binding) of De Civili Dominio. Of
this balance, AE25O odd has since been paid away-AE178 for
De Ecclesia (2315ss printing‚ ,3822 binding), and §72 odd for
Dialoqas (2351 printing, ..⁴321 binding)—-leaving 3377 avail-
able for the 1884 De Ooiiiposicione Hominis, with the right
to increase that sum by part or all of the ..850 paid in
advance for De Benedicta Inoarnacione in 1884.

The Society has now 368 Members. If they all pay
their subscriptione, two volumes—one, thick3 one, thiu—can
be issued by the Society for 1886. But it cannot be too
strongly imprest on Members' minds, that on them, and them
only, depends the extent of the Society's issues. If they will
but find the money, and canvass all Library-Oommittees and
friends within their range, to join the Society‚ its Editors
will give them the books.

The present state of the Society's work is this:

I. The Rev. Edward Harris's edition of the De Benedicta
Iiicariiacioiie (232 pages, with full side-notes and collations)
is all printed3 but various causes have prevented as yet the
completion of the notes and indexes, and (as mentioned
in last Report) ‘ the difficulty of the subject, and the
subtlety and intricacy of Wyclif's argument, with the ne-
cessity of giving an historical sketch of the views of his near
predecessors on the Personality of Christ, will cause some
further delay in the issue of the book. Messrs. Austin of
Hertford are printing it.'

II. Mr. Rudolf Beer's edition of the De Composieione
Hominis has its text all in type at Oarl Fromme’s press in
Vienna. Mr. Matthew is revising the English side-notes to
it. Miss Alice Shirley will english its Introduction. Mr.
Beer hopes to finish the book by June.

III. The following works are copied, andin Editors' hands,
preparing for publication :

Summa Theologiae.
