the doctorate at about A.D. 1363. This year then will be the
earliest possible date for the treatise. And this conclusion is
confirmed by the position taken up here on the Eucharist.
Wodeford, quoted by Shirley‚ F asc. Zizan. p. xv, note 4, and by
F. D. Matthew, English WorRs, p. xxiii, notes three stages of
opinion in Wyelif on this subject. ‘Alias dum esset praedictus
magister Johannes sententiarius Oxoniae, ac etiam baccalarius
responsalis, publice tenuit et in scholis quod licet accidentia
sacramentalia essent in subjecto, tamen quod panis in consecra-

of Transubstantiation pure and simple] Et cum multae quaes-

in this treatise, page 190, line 23 seqq„ although in the same
passage he adopts the word ‘transubstantiatio,' and still speaks
of the celebrant priest as ‘ conficiens,' page 44, line 2.] Nunc

have here three stages of opinion ; the first while he was Master
of Arts and Bachelor of Divinity3 the second when he became
Doctor of Divinity; the third from the Confession of A.D. 1381st
All this points to the conclusion that this treatise belongs to the
beginning of Wyclif's doctorate: and for the reasons given by
Shirley this cannot be later than A.D. 1367. It belongs there-
screto the four years immediately preceding that date. There
