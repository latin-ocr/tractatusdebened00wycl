PREFAOE. xxvii

subject. “The assumption of human nature by the Creator
of it brings us to a point where conception absolutely fails—
where the light of imagination goes out—where language
moves without ideas—where all is lost in one vast and vague
emotion of awe.'' (Archer Butler, Lectures on Aneient Philo-
sophy, vol. i. p. 143.) And again,
‘⁴ Our little systems have their day 3
They have their day and eease to be z
They are but broken lights of Thee,
And Thou, O Lord, art more than they.’'
—TENNYs0N, Ia IlIemoriam, Introduction.

It is not then to be wondered at if Wyclif’s treatise on
the Inearnation leaves the reader unsatisfied. That he will
rise from it without increased respect and liking for its
author,I do not think possible: and to that end the labour
spent upon this edition has been willingly bestowed. No critic
will know better than myself how incompletely the work has
been done. At a distance froin libraries of reference, with other
occupation which has left only occasional leisure for the work,
and above all with knowledge insufficient for an adequate per-
formanee of my task, Ι have· done what I could.

The zealous eooperation of Mr. Rudolph Beer, of Vienna,
the readiness of Mr. F. D. Matthew to give me his continual
assistance and highly skilled counsel, the patience and en-
couraget‘nent of Dr. Furnivall have made the task a pleasant
one, and my hearty thanks are here tendered to them. To the
Provost and Fellows of Oriel College sor their exceptional
indulgence in lending and prolonging the loan of their MS.;
to Mr. R. S. Poole for several useful suggestions, and for a
skilled opinion on the writing‚ ete„ of the Oriel codex; to Dr.
Herzbergfraenkel for his repert on the Vienna Codices; and
also to various private friends for loans of books and other
assistance, Ι also desire to express sincere acknowledgments.
