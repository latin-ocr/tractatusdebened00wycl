PREFACE. xxi

about the time of Wyclif’s birth revived the great Nominal-
istic controversy. “ Universals‚ said Occam, bear the same
relation to the infinite number of individuals that signs do to
the things signified. The universal, be it a thought or a
word, is nothing but a sign which by suppositio is besorehand
taken to denote a number of individual things, and is thus the
common noun denoting them all.” Now Wyclif was from
the beginning to the end of his life a thorough Realist. In the
unprinted treatises, De Universalz'bus, De Ideis, Dc Materia et
Forma, he 5615 himself to prove and support the Realistic
hypothesis. In our treatise he assumes it as proved and
constantly (v, Index IV. Realiffln, Universals) inveighs against
1116 ‘doctores signorum,' ‘non ponentes universalia praeter
signa‚’ ‘ negantes universalia,’ etc„ although he nowhere
quotes 01 names Occam. Indeed, the theory is necessary to
his view of the Incarnation. The Word, Wyclif says, assumed
Man, not the person of any individual of the species Man,
nor yet abstract Humanity, but Man 1116 ‘ res communis' by
virtue of which the individual supposites aro what they are;
assumed Man as he 15 10 the ‘ forma exemplaris,' in the Divine
idea. Christ took on himself in the incarnation the nature
not osa man, 01 01 many men, but the ‘ communis humanitas '
of all men, so that he is at 0006 ‘ 0010100015 1101110’ and ‘ unicus
homo,' The Man (ch. xiii). And lest this should seem to place
‘ the Man Christ Jesus' at a distance from his brethren ‘the sons
of men‚' Wyclif constantly repeats that, to the Realist, it only
brings Christ nearer, nay, identifies him with other men : for

versal, are identical. Although he would not deny the extreme
Realistic position ‘universalia ante rem’ in the sense 01
priority in thought and causation, ‘ universalia in re ’ 15 Wyc'lif’s
favourite formula. ‘Every universal is identical with each
and all of its supposites' (page 145, line 19). Therefore
