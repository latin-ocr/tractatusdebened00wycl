xiv PREFACE.

The book is incomplete, having on its last page the beginning of a
tract on the poverty of Christ.

The writing varies very much in the volume; some parts being
much clearer and more careful than others. The worst is the De
Incarnatione, which is written very hurriedly‚ with excessivo eon-
tractions. The lines are generally crooked and very close together.
Some parts of the first treatise (De Saeerdotz'o) are almost as bad.

The relation of the MS. to the text of our tract is curious. Very
much is omitted, and the joining words and clauses of sentences are
commonly altered, while on the other hand long passages are given
verbatim from a good text.

Ι was at first inclined to hope we had here the notes of a pupil who
had heard the De Incarnatione as lectur-es, but I now take this copy
to be a summary made from a MS. for the use of the writer. The
parts copied eontain the main course of the argument, the omissions
being chiefly of illustrations and authorities cited. A listener would
be less choice in his selection and less fun in the pieces given. More-
over, the best judgments I can obtain say that the writing is not of
Wyelif’s time, but of the fifteenth century.
