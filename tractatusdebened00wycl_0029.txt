PREFACE. XXV'

allows himself to handle some of these ‘vermiculate questions,'‘
but his general attitude is that of impatience with them. He
wistfully regrets that the days are past ‘ ante Petrum Lom-
bardum,’ when men abstained from these futile hypotheses.
He denies the wisdom, he even fears the sinfulness (page 228,
11110 15) of discussing them. Thus, although with one foot he
stands in the Scholastic age, the other is secking a resting-
place elsewhere. He has no patience with the puerile vanity,
the love of novelty, the ainbition, the manifold discordances of
the ‘ moderns': he cares for reality, fact, truth. What God,
in fact, has done, that alone is real, is possible, is true (page
228). God’s word must be taken, and taken literally ⁴ de vi

What is the ‘concors sententia ' (page 159), what is the voice of
the Catholic Church in its interpretation? Listen to this ratherv

the new-sangled doctors. Thus we see in our author, while
still only a disputant in the schools at Oxsord, the germs of
his future revolt from medieval routine. He leans upon the
Bible (0011011100) absolutely: next, St. Augustine as ¹ subtilis-
simus explanator' 13 made most use of. St. 1101111 of Damascus,
St. Bonaventura, Hugo of St. Victor, are never questioned, but
quoted as absolute authorities: but St. Thomas Aquinas may
be inistaken (Chapter xiii), Duns Scotus and the modern
