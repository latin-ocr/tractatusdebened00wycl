NOTES.

Page l.-—Title. De Benedicta Iiiearizaeione 15 Wyelif's own descrip-
tion of this book in the first sentence of the Prologue.

P. 1, line 3.—-The De Anima, still unprinted, contains the
psychology on Which this treatise is based. It is referred to infra,
pp. 7, 22, 44, 203, 230.

P. 1, 1. lO.——-The inclusion of Creation as well as Redemption in
the scope of the Incarnation is a note of the Scotists. But even
Aquinas III. Sent. Dist. i. Quest. 1, Art. 3, speaks of the Incarnation
as not only the deliverance from sin, but also as ‘humanae naturae
exaltatio et totius universi consummatio) Irenaeus, Athanasius and
other Fathers taught the same doctrine, which rests upon such
passages in Holy Scripture as Ephes. i. 4, 103 iii. 9-11; Col. i. 16,
17 3 St. John i. 4 3 Rom. viii, 19. For the history of scholastic opinion
on the subject see Dorner, Doctrine of the Person of Christ, Div. H.
vol. i. pp. 361-369, Eng. Tr. Wyclif returns to the subJ'ect infra,
pp. 79, 108, 199, 230.

P. 3, l. 2.—-v2'ant2·bus. In patristie and scholastic language viator
is 3 pilgrim 35 opposed to comprehensor or beatus in patria. Cf. infra,

P. 3, 1. 3.——removere prohibens disciplinam apparently means—to
get an obstacle to learning out of the way. Cf. p. 223, l. 15, for

{thlikfe-pfie οἳ neuter participle, repuynans fidei what is in opposition to
e 31 .

P. 3, l. 6.—Walden, Doctrinale Fidei, i. 39, denies Wyclif’s doctrine
of the threefold nature of Christ, which is the foundation of the treatise.

P. 3, l. 2l.—Walden also denies (D. F. i. 41) that Christ is a
creature.

P. 3, 1. 26.—Peter Lombard’s answer (Sent. Dist. iii. 11), Utrum
Christus sit ereatura vel creatus vel factus? is 35 follows: ‘Hoc
(ie. the affirmative) simpliciter et absque determinatione minus
congruenter dici . . . Etsi quandoque brevitatis causa simpliciter
denuncietur, nunquam tamen simpliciter debet intelligi)

P. 4, l. 8.—ad Felicianum. The true title is Contra Felicianum
Arianum de Unitate Trinitatis. The treatise is not considered genuine
by the Benedictine editors, but is assigned to Vigilius Tapsensis. It
