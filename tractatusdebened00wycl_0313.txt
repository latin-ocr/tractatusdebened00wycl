about four of the Sermones Micon· in Shirley's Catalogue are

ssruring each of the three years 1887, ’8, ⁷9, the Oom-
mittee hope that one of the Society's Editors will have
ready either a short Book of the Summa, or a set of the·
Miscellaneous Treatises, so as to k'eep the Society's issue up
to two volumes a year. But as the copying of the Logical
and Philosophieal Works is still going on, more money is
wanted to enable the Sooiety to keep up its yearly two
volumes. As time goes on, lukewarm subscribers fall off,
good friends die. The continuers and survivors who care
for Wyclif's memory, must show that care by getting fresh
Members for the Society, which has yet at least ten years'
work before it, possibly fifteen. Members must look their
undertaking full in the face, and resolve to ‘put it through.’

4. The Exeoutive'Committee repeat their thanks to the
Society's Editors, Oopiers, and Helpers, and specially to
Messrs. R. L. Poole‚ J. Loserth, F. D. Matthew, A. Pollard,

Bullook‚ and Miss Alioe Shirley. The Sooiety’s thanks are
also due to the Groverning Bodies of Trinity College, Cam-
bridge3 Trinity College, Dublin; Oriel College, Oxford; and
the University Libraries of Vienna and Prag, for loans of
MSS. for the use of the Sooiety's Editors.

5. The Subscription to the Society is One Guinea a year,
payable on every F irst of J anuary. The payment of five
