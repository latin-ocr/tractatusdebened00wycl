P. 64, 1. 11.-—ineorrupez'onem. Possibly interrupez‘onem is the word
intended.

P. 65, ll. 3—16.-This passage illustrates W.'s personal humility,
his reliance on the authority first of Scripture, then of the Church
Fathers and doctors, then his grotesque humour, and withal his strong
personal clinging to saith, and his robust common sense.

P. 65, l. 9.—The question was seriously entertained by Scotus
whether Grod could have assumed the nature of a lower animal.
Wilberforce on the Incarnation, p. 209, ed. 3 (1850), glances at this
strange hypothesis. Cf. infra, p. 197.

P. 65, l. 19.— Quod Filius Dei ozon potest desinere esse bomo is one of
the ‘earliest heresies’ of W.‚ apparently attacked by Kenyngham at
Oxford. The position which W. takes up in this chapter in proof
of the eontinuous humanity of Christ, Quod Deus de potentia sua
absoluta non potest damnare illam ereaturam, demonstrando illam quae
est unita Christo, is also condemned. Of. Faso. Ziz. p. 2.

P. 67, 1. 18.- Cesarem semper Auyustum here seems to refer to God the
Father. W. also applies the title to Christ. Lechler, ii. 69 and 91 ;
De Ecclesia, p. 124. Bryce, Holy Roman Empire, ed. iv. p. 219, note,
says—‘ imperatore domino nostro J esu Christo' is a form not uncommon
in the Middle Ages——especially during vacancies of the imperial throne.

P. 67, l. 28.—-Arist0tle, Phys. H. 3. ἔτι δὲ τὸ αὐτὸ τῶν ε’ ννννννν
ἐστὶν αἴτιον· ὅτγὰρ παρὸν αἴτιον τοῦδε, τοῦτο καὶ ἀπὸν αἰτιώμεθα ἐνίοτε
τοῦ ἐναντίου, οἷον τὴν ἀπουσίαν τοῦ κυβερνητοῦ τῆς ’τοῦ πλοίου
ἀνατροπῆς, οὗ ἦν ἡ παρουσία αἰτία τῆς σωτηρίας.

P. 68,1. 4.-Aquinas, S. T. III. l. ii. 3 (Migne, iv. 462). Cum
igitur in Christo nullum fuerit peccatum, impossibile fuit quod solve-
retur unio divinitatis a carne ipsius.

P. 69, l. 23.-6α7“ί87)ἰαέαηίΞχαρισμάτων.

P. 70, 1. 26.-That Christ was at once comprehensor perfect in grace
and felicity, one who has reached the goal (1 Cor. ix. 243 Phil. iii. 12).
as well as viator, one who is hastening toward it, was the traditional
scholastic view from St. Thomas downwards. Dorner, Person of
Christ, Div. H. vol. i. p. 333. Duns Scotus questioned it, Dorner
l.c. p. 348. On this subject, Bruce, Humiliation of Christ, p. 79,
remarks: “The Christ of. Aquinas is after all not our brother, not a
man, but only a ghastly simulacrum. Not to speak of his material
part which, according to the author of the Summa, was perfectly
formed from the first moment of conception, and born without pain:
the soul of Christ differed from ours to an extent which makes us feel
that between Him and us there is little in common.'’ W. seems to
be trying to save the reality of the wealmess of Christ after the fiesh
by the limiting word arralz'ter.

P. 70, 1. 29.—dotes eorporis (cf. infra, p. 181, 231), the four endow-
ments of the glorified body, subtilty, agssity, incorruptibility, trans-
parency‚ of which ‘Christ toke ernes here in this world,' are dwelt
on in an interesting passage in Wyclif’s English Sermons, Arnold,
