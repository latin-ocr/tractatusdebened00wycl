3, That, although monarchy has, under present conditions,
many advantages, the best form of government is aristocracy,
of which the typical example is the rule of the Hebrew
judges. 4, That the Ohurch, that is, the whole Christian
community, of England may righteously deprive the clergy
of their endowments.

The two next books state more at length Wyclif's view of
the Church, both in idea and realisation. In De Dominio
Civili, ch. xliii„ he had shown shortly that the Church ‘is
the entire body of the predestinate, past, present and future,
whose head and eternal director is Christ.’ 1 In De Ecclesia
he restates and developes this view 3 divides the Ghurch into
three parts,—l, the triumphant (the blessed in heaven),
2, the sleeping (the souls in purgatory), 3, the militant (the
Christians fighting with the world)‚— shows that no mere
man, and so Pope, can be Head of the Ohurch3 that it is
impossible :for us to know who is a member of the Ohurch,
and that the Canonization of Saints is therefore a ground-
less and mischievous practice. He then lays down the
relations which should subsist between Ohurch and State,
contends that no abbey or church lies outside the King's
jurisdiction, and strongly upholds the civil authority of the
King over the clergy, and the duty of the laity to deprive
the clergy of their temporalties if they misuse them. The
book concludes with an argument and protest against the
abuse of Indulgences‚ which were adopted (iu the main) by
Hus.2 To the scholar who discovered the full extent of Hus's
great debt to Wyolif, Prof. Loserth, of Ozernowitz, the
Society is indebted for the edition of De Ecclesia. Miss
Alice Shirley was so kind as to english his Introduction,
and Mr. Matthew to write the English side-notes.

The Dialoqas or Speculum Ecclesiae Militantis is mainly on
the endowment of the Ohurch, and teaches that all property
held by it in direct ownership must be abolished, though tithes
are not condemned, if used properly. The Pope is Antichrist's
vicar rather than Christ’s ; and ‘it might be good for the
Ohurch to be without a Pope.' The Dialoyics is also im-
portant as fixing an earlier date than was before known,
1379, for Wyclif's reaching his final opinion on Transub—
stantiation, that ‘ Consecration is not material, but spiritual ;
and the Host, although at every point in it verily and indeed
