xxviii PREFACE.

‘Parting with what has been the oompanion of my leisure for
many a mouth, whssst I regret the many imperfectione, of
which I am oonscious in the work, yet I do venture to hope
that even as it is it may contribute something towards the truer
-appreciation of John Wyclifi and may even aid in what was the
supreme purpose of his life—to win for himself and his race
⁴ increase in the knowledge of God.’
