PREFACE. xvii

alternative readings of ‘ille ' and ‘ iste,' and a few unimportant
variatione in the order of the words. I have endeavoured also to
give the spelling, Ι must not say the orthography, of the MSS„
even when it is manifestly incorrect, ey. metlzczplzisz'ca, anthi-
cesz's, dyabolus. Editions like this, besides their interest to
students of theology or philosophy, contribute material also
to the students of langnage. It is noticeable in this con-
nection that there is scarcely any Greek word which is not
misspelt.

As to the relative valne of the MSS„ Ι think O 15 the best,
as probably it is the oldest; but the contributions to a good
text, furnished by Mr. Beer and Mr. MattheW, are invaluable.
A careful analysis of the various readings will, Ι think, establish
this one point, the only 0110 to which Ι can see a 01110, as to
the relation between O and A, Β, O, viz, that O 15 more nearly
allied to C than to either A or B. Besides numerous smaller
coincidences peculiar to O and O, there is a remarkable omission
(p. 68, 11. 19-25) common only to these two codices.

There is a strange historical ignorance displayed in A, B,
and less distinctly in C, on page 155, 11110 21, where the two
former insert ‘Nestorius,' the latter ‘ n,' in the text to explain
the ‘clericus in fide devins' against whom St. Anselm wrote
his treatise on the Incarnation. Of course it is Roscellinus
who is referred to (v, Note-ad 100. cit.).

Besides the short omission on page 68, just mentioned,
as common to O and O, there are two longer passages
wanting in O, and in O only. The former of these, page 134,
line 31, to page 136, 11110 25, contains the statement of a
metaphysical objection to Wyclif’s doctrine, which 15 also the
Catholic doctrine, that Christ did not become a person by the
Incarnation, and the answer to that objection. The omission
is cleanly made, and does not seem to be due to a copyist’s
carelessness; rather the passage appears to be an addition to
