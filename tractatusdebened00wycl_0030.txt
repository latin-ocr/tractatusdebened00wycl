xxvi PREFACE.

saints (quotlibet dicta sanctorum, p. 190, 1. 25), which soem to
mean (sonant), that even after consecration the bread and wine
are bread and wine. Hc makes a praiseworthy effort (ll. 26-29)
to explain their words away in what seems to him the 0111101101
sense, but gives up the attempt to define the Eucharistic change
as unnecessary to a ‘ pilgrim’s ' saith.

It must be confessed that Wyclif’s mind is as yet a strange
medley: he uses the very methods which he condemns; 110
wanders into hypotheses where in the attempt to follow him
one finds oneself ‘moving about in worlds not realized‚' and
for me, at any rate, the attempt to analyse his meaning breaks
down (0.9. Chapter xi. pp. 194-199> : the width and variety of
his knowledge tempts him to combine incongrnous materials:
Aristotle and Euchd, Averroe's and Aviccnna are brought to
bear on a doctrine of revelation. He makes the hazardous
claim that all Christian truth may be established on grounds of
reason, even the mirac-les explained ‘lumine naturali' (page
159), even the Catholic faith as to the Eucharist philosophically
sustained by parallels from the natural sciences. In much of
this treatise there is crudity and confusion ; but yet there is
valso the germ of the revolt from medieval Rome, and the
prophecy of the English Bible. The greater part of the
treatise, now for the first time generally accessible, will continue
to be unread: and those who follow his reasoning will come
to the inevitable conclusion which we almost start to find that
Wyclif himself had reached, that human thought and language
are, after all, unequal 10 1116 task of dealing absolutely with
such themes. Seldom has this sense of ‘ knowing only in part'
been more boldly expressed than in these words of Wyclif
<page 115, 11116 20), “ Imo si non fallor omnis locucio nostra
de Deo est figurativa—Non enim habemus nomina quae sine
figura Deum signent.'’ This is scarcely less distinct than two
contemporary utterances with which Ι venture to conclude this
