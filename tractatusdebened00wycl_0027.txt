illud Jocale preciocissimum’ (page 54, 1105 20), which he
will not surrender. Hence his labour in Chapters i. ii. v,
to establish as catholic truth that ‘ Christ is a creature': hence
115 argues that ‘ Christ did 1101 05355 111 1115 three days and
never can cease to be man,' in Chapters iii. iv. v. viii.: the
Jesus of the Gospel narrative is the same yesterday, to-day,
and for ever. Moreover, Christ and the Humanity of Christ
are henceforth one never to be divided² this is the contentiori
of Chapter X.: that Christ is 111311 in the plain sense of the
word ‘inan' is the gist of Chapter vi.: that he is liable to
all the ills that fiesh is heir to (mobilis) is the argument of

off him, and he rises into a real beauty and eloquence of ex-
pression when possessed by this thought, (3.9. page 64, lines 24

clinging to the humanity of Christ, Wyclif does not yield to any

Christ is three natures—Deitas, anima, corpus: two forms, God
and Man. His doctrine of the Word is that of the orthodox
Fathers and Schoolmen, but he brings into prominence the
ideal and potential existence of all things 111 1115 Word (page 12,
1105 13). The Word is both Deity and all ideas, 226, 311 1115
truth (page 113, line 21). This doctrine of the Realist doctor, as
Lechler has shown, is based on St. John i. 4, according to the
punctuation of the Vulgate: ‘All that was made in Him was
lifo3 ' and it 15 supported by the traditional identification of the

ghastly simulacrum.’—Bruce‚ Humiliation of Christ, p. 79.
