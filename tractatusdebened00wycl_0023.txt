“A papal bull was issued by Pope Alexander V. December 20,
1409, conferring on Zbinco, Archbishop of Prague, the commission to
take measures against the heretical doctrines. . . . The commission,
which he had called together in accordance with the papal bull,
pronounced the judgment . . . which was likewise proclaimed by
Zbinco at the summer Synod of 1410—that the books of Wyclif
should be burnt. . . . Of the books of Wyclif the following were
mentioned by name 2—1. Dialogus, 2. Trialogus, 3. De Incarna-
oione Verbi Divini; 4. De Corpore Christi3 5. De Trinitate3 6. De
Ideis3 7. De Hypotheticis; 8. Decalogus3 9. De Universalibus
Realibus3 10. De Simonia3 11. De Fratribus Dyscolis et Malis;
12. De Probacionibus Proposicionum; 13. De Attributis; 14. De
Individuacione Temporis 3 15. De Materia et F0rma3 16. De Dominio
Civili ; 17. Super evangelia sermones per circulum anni.

Against this decision the university was the first to raise its voice,
on the 2lst of June: then Hus, who, four days later, in conjunction
with seven others belonging to the university, addressed a solemn
appeal to John XXIII. <who had meanwhile succeeded Alexander V.
as Pope) . . . .

As regards the prohibiting of the possession of Wyclif’s books, the
appeal points out that only a fool, who is entirely devoid of acquaint-
ance with the Bible and with canon law, could consign to the flames
the logical, philosophical, moral, mathematical, theophysical books;
as also those on matter and form, on ideas, etc., which contain many
noble and glorious truths, but not a single error. Moreover, Hus
urged, by the death of Alexander V„ the authority entrusted to Zbinco
for this prosecution had lapsed.

The university had meanwhile invoked the mediation of the King3
and at his intervention the Archbishop consented to postpone the
execution of the sentence until the Margrave J ost should have come
to Prague from Moravia. As, however, the arrival of the Margrave
was delayed, Zbinco caused Wyclif’s books to be burnt on the leth
July. This auto-da-Je was carried into effect in the court of the
archiepiscopal palace on the Hradschin, in the presence of the Cathe-
dral Chapter and a great multitude of priests. More than 200 MSS.
were consumed, containing the works of Wyclif. Stress has been
laid upon the fact that several of them were sumptuously bound.
Yet only the smaller proportion of Wyclif's books which were to be
