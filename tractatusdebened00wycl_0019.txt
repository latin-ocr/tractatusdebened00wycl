mutil, fol. 235.

This copy is undoubtedly of the date assigned in the Cata-
logue, asse. about A.D. 1400. The ornamentation and hand—
writing is distinctly English as one would expect. The initials
are delicately drawn and of simple design, consisting of leaves
of fiowers, but no heads of animals; and there is no pretence
to a high standard of illumination. The material, is vellum,
and is in good preservation, but little stained. The height of
the page is 423 oentimetres, the breadth 30: the height of
column 31, breadth 8333 interval between columns 1} centi-
metres. This gives a handsome margin. There are 72 lines
in each column, written on very faint lines ruled in red. The
large initial beginning the treatise‚ extending with its flourish,
from the top to the foot of the column, is in blue and vermilion:
as also are the smaller initials at the beginning of each chapter.
Paragraphs are marked with coloured initials alternately blue
and vermilion. At the top of right-hand margin of each leaf
is written W. de incarnatione Vb2·; there is no other title.
There is in the margin in parts a fitful kind of analysis of the
text3 but this is not continuone, nor always correct. Resides
this, occasionally the name of some author quoted in the text
is written in the margin, and such remarks as ‘nota bonam
rationem,' ‘ argumentum bonum.' To two such comments of
special interest Ι have called attention above, pp. vii, viii. From
the top of sol. 229 (p. 194‚1.3O of this edition) the numbers of the
imperfect numerica] analysis are framed in red, thus lOam 12121,

and from the same point the longer notes are generally under-
lined in red.

 

 

The punctuation is scanty and worthless, except in the case
of paragraphs, which generally correspond with a new sentence.
Only fresh chapters begin with a new line: there is 110 other
break in the text3 and the breaking up 111 this edition has been
