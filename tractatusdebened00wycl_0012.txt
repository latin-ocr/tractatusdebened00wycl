and the other, also a marginal note, fol. 234<ss on a line with
page 921, line 18, in this edition, ‘ sententia Johis.’

The absence of Wyclif’s name from the beginning and end is
probably due to prudentia] reasons, in view of the Lollard perse-
cution: just as a similar cause led to the strange misplacement
of the letters in the several words of the Incipits and Explicits in
many ofthe Polemical Tracts, as shown by Dr. Buddensieg.

II. The treatise then being unquestionably written by Wychf,
to what time of his life does it belong?

There is no reason to question that Shirley was right in as-

Oxford. Besides the fifth in this list those ‘ haereses' numbered
3, 4, 6, and 7, are all enunciated in this treatise, and all main-

ever may be the author of the narrative in Fasc. Zizan.‚ is right
in stating that these doctrines of Wyclif were not opposed until
their author became doctor of divinity‚ ⁴ cathedram doctoris
audax arriperet,' it seems to follow that the treatise in its present
form belongs to the early days of his doctorate. Shirley, in his
Preface to Fasc. Zizan.‚ gives good reason for fixing the date of
