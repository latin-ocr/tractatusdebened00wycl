xxiv PREFACE.

‘Word’ of St. John with the ‘Wisdom' of Proverbs and the
Book of Wisdom‚ which our author enlarges upon, pp. 11, 12,
and chapter vii.

But the treatise being obviously controversial, he does not
dwell long on points like this, then generally admitted. He is
controversial, but he is more concerned to establish positive
truth than to establish or refute various negations rife in the
schools. He can agree to most men's affirmations: their
sweeping negations he may perhaps admit with limitations (page
13, line 10). He takes 1115 stand on the plain literal meaning
of Holy Scripture. The facts vouched for there are enough
for him. Hence he is impatient of the number-less questions
which arise out os hypotheses which the Schoolmen had pro-
pounded. The question as to the necessity of the Incarnation
he does not directly handle; but, in contrast to the generality
of the Schoolmen, 110 clearly would answer the question in the
affirmative. Only through the lncarnation is the Divine Idea in
Man realized. Peter Lombard had raised the question whether
the Incarnation could have been accomplished by the Father
or the Holy Spirit. Towards the end of the treatise Wyclif
replies in the negative, Chapter xiii.

Likewise he shrinks from admitting with Aquinas the possi-
bility of the Word assuming many humanities: to this he
replies that in assuming the ‘ communis humanitas,' he assumed
not one or many, but all humanities, He makes what seems
to us unseemly mirth (page 65, line 10) over the Scotist
hypothesis of the possibility of the assumption of a non-human
animal nature.¹ In the concluding chapters xi. xii. xiii. he

¹ Lest any hasty modern reader should dub the Schoolman ‘dunce’ for such a
thought, he may find in Wilberforce on the Incarnation, ed. iii. 1850, p. 209, the
same hypothesis glanced at. ⁴⁴ Had God been pleased to employ the organs of some
inferior animal . . . for the expression of His will, such nature had not been
susceptible of that personal union with Him which is set forth in the Incarnation
ot Christ.'’ And near parallels to the Scholastic hypotheses and questions on this
subject may, I believe, be found by the curious in the controversy which took place
some forty years ago among the Christians commonly called ‘ Brethren' on the Very
Humanity of Christ.
