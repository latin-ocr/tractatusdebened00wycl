‘unica communis humanitas est quelibet persona hominis'
(page ΞΟ, 11116 10), ie. the one common Humanity is identical
with any individual man: again (page 218, line 8) ‘hic com-
munis homo . . . est idem singularis homo, omnium hominum
quilibet) Christ is the ‘homo communis‚’ the idea of Man;
by the Incarnation he is objectively ‘unicus homo': he is
‘eadem communis humanitas que est quilibet frater suus’
(page 101, 11116 528). Certainly here was a brave and subtle
effort to give 10 1116 understanding a reason sor the saith that
Christ is one with all his brethren. lt is another conspicuous
instance of our author’s desire to fix his foundations deep and
solid. He was not content with metaphorical expressions
about membership in Christ3 he essays to establish that union
on a metaphysica] necessity, and to bring it home to others
as a logical sequence. Different minds will estimate differently
the value of the attempt,· and if few in our day can accept

reality, by reason also of the logical identity of universal and
particular, the identification of Christ 1116 1110616616 Word with
each individual man, is the keystone of the treatise, and is, so far

Β111 Wyclif has more than a scholastic, 111016 61166 111611 6
theological interest, in vindicating the reality of Christ's
humanity. At times his style glows, his beart seems 10 throb
beneath the words, as he struggles 10 express the intensity
of his conviction. The literal 16611151 of Christ’s human
nature is a ‘most precious jewel,’ ‘absoluta humanitas Christi
